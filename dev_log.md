- Executed Phase 1 database enhancements:
  - Extended Prisma schema with challenge, KYC, payment, and metrics models plus supporting enums.
  - Reset and migrated the PostgreSQL database to align with the updated schema.
  - Seeded three predefined challenge plans for Levels 1-3 using a Prisma seeding script.

- Delivered Phase 2 mocked KYC flow end to end:
  - Built the `/kyc` client experience with validation, status messaging, and post-approval routing.
  - Added the `/api/kyc/submit` auto-approval endpoint and wired auth responses to include KYC state.
  - Gated dashboard interactions and introduced a challenge plan placeholder route pending phase 3.
- Executed Phase 3 challenge plan selection capabilities:
  - Implemented `/api/challenges/plans`, `/api/challenges/select`, and `/api/challenges/selection` endpoints for plan discovery and persistence.
  - Shipped the `/challenge-plans` comparison interface with reservation flow into the mocked payment checkpoint.
  - Surfaced reserved plan details and payment handoffs on the trader dashboard, plus added the mock payment placeholder.
- Concluded Phase 4 mocked payment processing:
  - Released `/api/payment/mock` to log Razorpay-style transactions, activate challenges, and emit demo credentials.
  - Upgraded `/payments/mock` with confirmation UX, credential copy helpers, and redirect handling.
  - Integrated dashboard payment summaries, credential surfacing, and transaction metadata displays.

- Completed Phase 5 challenge monitoring initiatives:
  - Delivered `/api/challenges/status/[id]` with automatic metric seeding and progress summaries.
  - Replaced trader dashboard placeholders with live mocked analytics and credential handling.
  - Launched `/dashboard/user/challenge` for deep-dive monitoring and KPI review.

- Executed Phase 6 automated challenge evaluation:
  - Built `evaluateChallenge` rule engine in `/lib/evaluateChallenge.ts` to validate all challenge guardrails:
    - Profit target achievement (cumulative P&L vs target percentage)
    - Max loss limit enforcement (drawdown and cumulative loss checks)
    - Daily loss violations detection across all metrics
    - Challenge duration expiry validation
    - Next level eligibility determination
  - Implemented `/api/challenges/evaluate` endpoints:
    - POST evaluates active challenges and updates database status
    - GET provides evaluation preview without persisting changes
    - Supports filtering by challengeId or userId for targeted evaluations
    - Batch evaluates all active challenges when no filter provided
    - Records violation details with type, date, description, and severity
  - Created `/challenges/[id]/result` completion page:
    - Dynamic status display (PASSED/FAILED/ACTIVE) with contextual styling
    - Performance summary cards (progress %, cumulative P&L, trades, win rate)
    - Detailed violation list with timestamps and explanations
    - Recent metrics table showing last 10 trading days
    - Context-aware CTAs: "Start Next Level" for passed, "Try Again" for failed
    - Suspense boundary for Next.js 16 compatibility
  - Production build verified: 25 routes compiled successfully with zero TypeScript errors
