- Executed Phase 1 database enhancements:
  - Extended Prisma schema with challenge, KYC, payment, and metrics models plus supporting enums.
  - Reset and migrated the PostgreSQL database to align with the updated schema.
  - Seeded three predefined challenge plans for Levels 1-3 using a Prisma seeding script.

## 2025-10-31
- Delivered Phase 2 mocked KYC flow end to end:
  - Built the `/kyc` client experience with validation, status messaging, and post-approval routing.
  - Added the `/api/kyc/submit` auto-approval endpoint and wired auth responses to include KYC state.
  - Gated dashboard interactions and introduced a challenge plan placeholder route pending phase 3.
- Executed Phase 3 challenge plan selection capabilities:
  - Implemented `/api/challenges/plans`, `/api/challenges/select`, and `/api/challenges/selection` endpoints for plan discovery and persistence.
  - Shipped the `/challenge-plans` comparison interface with reservation flow into the mocked payment checkpoint.
  - Surfaced reserved plan details and payment handoffs on the trader dashboard, plus added the mock payment placeholder.
- Concluded Phase 4 mocked payment processing:
  - Released `/api/payment/mock` to log Razorpay-style transactions, activate challenges, and emit demo credentials.
  - Upgraded `/payments/mock` with confirmation UX, credential copy helpers, and redirect handling.
  - Integrated dashboard payment summaries, credential surfacing, and transaction metadata displays.

- Completed Phase 5 challenge monitoring initiatives:
  - Delivered `/api/challenges/status/[id]` with automatic metric seeding and progress summaries.
  - Replaced trader dashboard placeholders with live mocked analytics and credential handling.
  - Launched `/dashboard/user/challenge` for deep-dive monitoring and KPI review.

- Executed Phase 6 automated challenge evaluation:
  - Built `evaluateChallenge` rule engine in `/lib/evaluateChallenge.ts` to validate all challenge guardrails:
    - Profit target achievement (cumulative P&L vs target percentage)
    - Max loss limit enforcement (drawdown and cumulative loss checks)
    - Daily loss violations detection across all metrics
    - Challenge duration expiry validation
    - Next level eligibility determination
  - Implemented `/api/challenges/evaluate` endpoints:
    - POST evaluates active challenges and updates database status
    - GET provides evaluation preview without persisting changes
    - Supports filtering by challengeId or userId for targeted evaluations
    - Batch evaluates all active challenges when no filter provided
    - Records violation details with type, date, description, and severity
  - Created `/challenges/[id]/result` completion page:
    - Dynamic status display (PASSED/FAILED/ACTIVE) with contextual styling
    - Performance summary cards (progress %, cumulative P&L, trades, win rate)
    - Detailed violation list with timestamps and explanations
    - Recent metrics table showing last 10 trading days
    - Context-aware CTAs: "Start Next Level" for passed, "Try Again" for failed
    - Suspense boundary for Next.js 16 compatibility

- Completed Phase 7 challenge progression system:
  - Implemented `/api/challenges/next-level` progression API:
    - GET endpoint determines eligible challenge levels based on user's pass history
    - Enforces sequential progression (must pass Level 1 before Level 2, etc.)
    - Returns `unlockedLevels` array, `highestPassedLevel`, and `canProgress` boolean
    - Validates no active challenges exist before allowing level selection
    - Provides full challenge history with pass/fail statuses for audit trail
    - Returns filtered `availablePlans` array for immediate plan selection
  - Enhanced `/challenge-plans` selection page with progression logic:
    - Added `progressionData` state tracking: highestPassedLevel, unlockedLevels, canProgress, reason
    - Implemented `fetchProgression` function to query next-level API on component mount
    - Added `isLocked` calculation per plan: `!progressionData?.unlockedLevels.includes(plan.level)`
    - Added `isPassed` detection for completed challenges to show completion badges
    - Visual lock indicators: ðŸ”’ Locked chip displayed on inaccessible challenge levels
    - Progression badges: "Completed" chip shown on passed challenges with success color
    - Locked plan styling: reduced opacity (0.6), grayscale background, grey border
    - Button logic: disabled state for locked plans with helpful message "Complete Level X first"
    - Dynamic button text shows progression requirements instead of generic "Reserve" on locked levels
    - Unlocked plans maintain original gradient styling and full interactivity
  - Production build verified: 26 routes compiled successfully with zero TypeScript errors
  - Updated MVP_TASK_PLAN.md: Overall progress advanced from 73% to 77% (37/48 tasks complete)

  - All HIGH priority tasks now complete âœ…

- Completed Phase 10 error handling & validation:
  - Created comprehensive error response utility (`/src/lib/apiResponse.ts`):
    - `errorResponse()` function creates standardized error responses with status codes and messages
    - `successResponse()` function creates consistent success response format
    - `ErrorHandlers` object with common error methods for all HTTP error types:
      * `badRequest()` - 400 Bad Request errors for invalid input or missing required fields
      * `unauthorized()` - 401 Unauthorized errors for authentication failures
      * `forbidden()` - 403 Forbidden errors for authorization/permission issues
      * `notFound()` - 404 Not Found errors for missing resources
      * `conflict()` - 409 Conflict errors for duplicate resources (e.g., existing email)
      * `validationError()` - 422 Unprocessable Entity errors with field-level validation details
      * `serverError()` - 500 Internal Server Error with optional debug details in development mode

    - `validateAddress()` - Address validation (10-500 characters minimum/maximum)
    - `validateRequired()` - Generic required field validator for any input type
    - All validators return `ValidationResult` interface: `{ valid: boolean; error?: string }`
    - Specific error messages for each validation failure (empty, too short, too long, invalid format)
  - Updated all API routes with standardized error handling:
    - `/api/auth/login` - Replaced manual error responses with ErrorHandlers methods
    - `/api/auth/signup` - Added email/password validation, conflict handling for existing users

      * Gradient background matching app theme
      * Includes Navbar component for consistent navigation
    - `/src/app/error.tsx` - Global error boundary (500 errors):
      * Error boundary catches unhandled React/Next.js errors
      * Shows error message in development mode for debugging
      * "Try Again" button calls reset() to re-render component tree
      * "Go Home" button for escape route
      * Gradient background consistent with theme
    - `/src/app/unauthorized/page.tsx` - 401 unauthorized access page:

      * Individual error states for each field (nameError, emailError, passwordError)
      * Helper text shows requirements: "Optional" for name, "Minimum 8 characters" for password
      * Real-time error clearing and feedback on input change
    - `/app/kyc/page.tsx` refactored with validation utility integration:
      * Replaced manual trim checks with `validateName()`, `validatePhone()`, `validateIdNumber()`, `validateAddress()`
      * Enhanced validation logic in `validate()` function with specific validators
